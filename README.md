# skills

A third-party marketplace of language-agnostic AI workflow plugins. Plugins
install into [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces.md)
and [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins), and are
readable by agents scanning `.agents/skills/`.

> **Warning:** Review plugins before installing. Anthropic does not control plugin
> contents and cannot verify they work as intended.

**Repository:** [tony/skills](https://github.com/tony/skills)

## Plugins

| Plugin | Category | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| [commit](plugins/commit/) | Development | Create git commits following project conventions with format enforcement and safety checks. |
| [weave](plugins/weave/) | Development | Run independent, adversarial AI participants via sub-agents or model CLIs to brainstorm, refine, plan, execute, architect, review, and synthesize. |
| [rebase](plugins/rebase/) | Development | Automated rebase onto trunk with conflict prediction, resolution, and quality gate verification. |
| [changelog](plugins/changelog/) | Productivity | Generate and maintain categorized changelog entries from branch commits and PR context. |
| [tdd](plugins/tdd/) | Testing | TDD bug-fix workflow: reproduce bugs as failing tests, determine root cause, fix, and verify. |
| [model-cli](plugins/model-cli/) | Development | Run prompts through individual AI CLIs — Antigravity/agy (Gemini), codex/GPT, and cursor/agent with fallback support. |
| [pr](plugins/pr/) | Development | Manage gold-standard PR descriptions. Detects AI slop and verbose commits, resolving them via fixup commits and autosquash. |
| [research](plugins/research/) | Learning | Study dependencies locally. Clones upstream repos and creates version-pinned worktrees matching your project's exact versions. |
| [slop](plugins/slop/) | Development | Scan tracked files for AI slop and verbose noise, resolving each finding with atomic, verified commits. |
| [tailwind](plugins/tailwind/) | Design | Detect and fix inconsistent spacing, margin/gap mixing, and padding asymmetry in Tailwind CSS layouts. |
| [pytest-optimizer](plugins/pytest-optimizer/) | Testing | Profile and optimize pytest suites. Ranks and applies safe speedups as verified, independent commits. |
| [spike](plugins/spike/) | Development | Run no-commit spikes, strategy bakeoffs, or multi-round convergence loops in git worktrees. Tests ideas against quality gates and returns a commit-by-commit implementation plan. |
| [respond](plugins/respond/) | Development | Screen review feedback from humans or bots before changing code. Verifies claims against facts and project decisions. Valid findings become gated, atomic commits; invalid ones get evidence-backed replies. |
| [action](plugins/action/) | Development | Convert tickets to branches in isolated worktrees. Uses team branch conventions, lands gated commits, and supports parallel tickets. |
| [lean](plugins/lean/) | Development | Writing discipline and cleanup tools for tight, slop-free prose and code. |
| [double-check](plugins/double-check/) | Productivity | Forces verification requests to return re-derived answers instead of diffs against prior turns. Includes an alignment tool for repairing chats. |
| [release](plugins/release/) | Development | Cut and bump releases with safe defaults (no automatic push/tag). Rolls out releases to downstream consumers with CI verification. |
| [merge-pr](plugins/merge-pr/) | Development | Merge PRs matching repo history conventions. Includes readiness checks, CI watching, stack detection, and automated rebasing. |
| [business](plugins/business/) | Productivity | Measure and report the business value of AI workflows with provenance-tagged data — metrics in engineer-hours and cycle time, never currency. |
| [disk](plugins/disk/) | Productivity | Safely reclaim disk space. Classifies consumers as cache, redundant copy, or history, deleting only what is proven safe. |
| [github-actions](plugins/github-actions/) | Development | Update GitHub Actions pins fleet-wide. Verifies tags, researches release notes, commits each action separately, and supersedes Dependabot PRs. |
| [situate](plugins/situate/) | Development | Gain situational awareness before modifying code. Scans branches, PRs, tickets, and project conventions to orient the agent and verify the work required. |
| [terraform](plugins/terraform/) | Development | Upgrade Terraform and OpenTofu versions. Discovers every root module, moves provider constraints together because they combine across modules, and refreshes lock files. |
| [ruff](plugins/ruff/) | Development | Upgrade Ruff across repositories. Works out which new rules can fire against each repo's select list and lands one reviewed commit per rule, citing the upstream rule doc. |
| [git-branch](plugins/git-branch/) | Development | Rebuild branch history into atomic commits (byte-identical), or reimplement from scratch using existing tests as the spec. Includes an interactive-rebase toolkit. |
| [package-updater](plugins/package-updater/) | Development | Update dependencies and toolchains across repositories. Checks the supply-chain cooldown first, then commits toolchain, named bumps, and lockfile refreshes separately with release notes cited. |
| [gh](plugins/gh/) | Development | File durable GitHub issues with reproductions, pinned links, and stripped PII. Enforces a markdown writing discipline reusable for any PR, comment, or ticket. |
| [self-improvement](plugins/self-improvement/) | Development | Mine local agent prompt history for how the skill catalog is really used, then land the changes that usage evidence supports. |
| [ticket](plugins/ticket/) | Development | Manage work across trackers (Linear, Jira, GitHub, etc.) respecting each platform's native object graph. Drafts durable tickets focused on invariants. |

## Installation

### Claude Code

Add the marketplace:

```console
/plugin marketplace add tony/skills
```

You can also browse available plugins with `/plugin > Discover`.

Then install any plugin by the name in the table above:

```console
/plugin install commit@skills
```

### Codex

Add the marketplace:

```console
codex plugin marketplace add tony/skills
```

Then install any plugin by the name in the table above:

```console
codex plugin add commit@skills
```

Each workflow is one skill, invoked as `pr:deslop` under Codex and
`/pr:deslop` under Claude Code.

## Design Philosophy

All plugins are **language-agnostic**. Instead of hardcoding language-specific
tools (e.g., `pytest`, `jest`, `cargo test`), they dynamically read project
conventions from `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` to discover:

- Test suite, linter, formatter, and type checker commands
- Commit message formats
- Test patterns

This ensures compatibility across languages like Python, TypeScript,
Rust, and Go.

## Development

Scripts use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python dependencies.

Install uv:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

or:

```bash
wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

See [uv installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for
other methods.

### Lint and validate

```bash
uv run ./scripts/marketplace.py lint
```

### Sync marketplace manifest with plugin directories

Dry-run:

```bash
uv run ./scripts/marketplace.py sync
```

Write changes to marketplace.json:

```bash
uv run ./scripts/marketplace.py sync --write
```

### Check for outdated entries

```bash
uv run ./scripts/marketplace.py check-outdated
```

### Regenerate the portable skill export

`.agents/skills/` is a generated, flattened mirror of every plugin skill for
agents outside Claude Code (Cursor, pi, Antigravity, Grok). It contains
spec-only frontmatter with no host-specific inline-bash expansion. Files are
copied and links rewritten to make each exported skill self-contained.

Codex reads `skills/` in place and consumes plugins directly via
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`.

```bash
uv run ./scripts/marketplace.py portable
```

Verify the committed tree matches the generated plugins:

```bash
uv run ./scripts/marketplace.py portable --check
```

- **Edit:** `plugins/*/skills/`
- **Do not edit generated files:** `.agents/skills/`, `.agents/plugins/`,
  or `plugins/*/.codex-plugin/`

`.agents/portable-manifest.json` tracks exported skill sources and
bundled files.

Hosts scanning `.agents/skills/` read the tree directly. The `skills` CLI
also reads this tree:

```bash
npx skills add tony/skills
```

This installs only the export. The `metadata.pluginRoot` in the marketplace
manifest prevents duplicate skill renderings from being exposed.

### Code quality for scripts

Lint:

```bash
uv run ruff check ./scripts/
```

Format check:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check ./scripts/
```

Type check:

```bash
uv run basedpyright ./scripts/
```
