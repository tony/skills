# Refresh Terraform lock files

Re-resolve providers to the newest versions the existing constraints
allow, in every root module, and report what actually moved.

This changes no constraint. When a provider will not move, the
constraint is what is holding it — use `/terraform:bump-provider`.

Use `../bumping-terraform/SKILL.md` for the
phase structure, and these two references for the parts that go wrong:
`../../references/layout-discovery.md` and
`../../references/lock-and-init.md`.

User arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Context

Repository:
`!git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "(not a git repository)"`

Providers each committed lock holds, and the most platforms any one of them tracks:
`!git ls-files -- '*.terraform.lock.hcl' 2>/dev/null | while read -r f; do printf '%s: providers=%s max_platforms_per_provider=%s\n' "$f" "$(grep -c '^provider ' "$f")" "$(awk '/^provider /{n=0} /"h1:/{n++; if(n>m) m=n} END{print m+0}' "$f")"; done | grep . || echo "(no committed lock file — nothing to refresh)"`

Directories with a backend or cloud block:
`!git grep -lE '^[[:space:]]*(backend[[:space:]]+"|cloud[[:space:]]*\{)' -- '*.tf' '*.tofu' 2>/dev/null | xargs -r -n1 dirname | sort -u | grep . || echo "(none)"`

Tooling available:
`!{ command -v terraform >/dev/null 2>&1 && terraform -version | head -1; command -v tofu >/dev/null 2>&1 && tofu -version | head -1; } 2>/dev/null | grep . || echo "(neither terraform nor tofu on PATH)"`

## Procedure

### 1. Discover every root module

Run the skill's discovery phase. A repository routinely has several
root modules and therefore several lock files; refreshing one and
reporting success is the failure this command exists to prevent.

`--root-module` limits the run to the named directories. A directory
holding a backend block but no committed lock file is a finding — its
lock is either untracked or was never created.

A repository with no lock file anywhere is a module repository with
nothing to refresh. Say so; it is not a failure.

### 2. Record the starting state

Per root module: the version selected for each provider, and how many
platforms each provider's entry tracks. Both are needed afterwards —
the first to report what moved, the second to detect a narrowed file.

### 3. Present the plan and wait

Show the root modules to be refreshed and how many platforms each lock
tracks. With `--audit-only`, stop here — nothing is written.

### 4. Refresh, one root module at a time

Per the lock reference: `-chdir` rather than a subshell `cd`, and
`-backend=false -input=false -upgrade` so the run needs no cloud
credentials and cannot stall on a prompt.

Compare each lock's per-provider platform count afterwards against what
it was before. Selecting a new version records only the running
platform's hash, which silently discards coverage somebody established
deliberately — and because the file names no platforms, a count that
dropped is a stop signal, not something to reconstruct by guessing.

A root module that fails to refresh does not stop the others. Record
the failure and continue.

### 5. Commit

One commit for the lock files. They are generated output; keep them out
of any commit carrying authored changes. With `--no-commit`, leave them
in the working tree and say what would have been committed.

### 6. Verify and report

Read each lock back and compare the selected versions to the starting
state. Report per root module what moved, what did not, and — where a
provider stayed put — whether a constraint is holding it.

Run the detected tool's `fmt -check -recursive` — `tofu` where OpenTofu
drives the repository — and whatever gates the repository defines for
itself. Never report a gate as passing without reading the output that
says so.

## Rules

- Every root module is refreshed, not only the first one found.
- Constraints are never edited by this command.
- A lock file never comes back tracking fewer platforms than it had.
- A failure in one root module never silently ends the run.
- Success is read out of the lock file, never inferred from an exit
  code.

## Output

Open with a one-line hero (`✓ N of M lock files moved` or `⚠ Audit
only: M lock files found`), then exactly these sections:

1. `## Root modules` — every one discovered, and any directory with a
   backend but no committed lock file.
2. `## Changes` — per root module and provider: the version before and
   after, and the platform count tracked before and after.
3. `## Held back` — providers that did not move, and the constraint
   holding each.
4. `## Verification` — the gates run and their real results.
5. `## Failures` — root modules that could not be refreshed, and why.

End with an `AskUserQuestion` panel offering next steps — for example:
bump a constraint that is holding a provider back, restore
multi-platform coverage, commit an untracked lock file, or stop here.
Skip the panel only in plan mode.
