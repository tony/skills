# git-branch

Rebuild branch history into atomic commits (byte-identical), or reimplement
from scratch using existing tests as the spec. Includes an interactive-rebase
toolkit.

## Installation

In Claude Code, add the marketplace:

```console
/plugin marketplace add tony/skills
```

Install the plugin:

```console
/plugin install git-branch@skills
```

In Codex, add the marketplace:

```console
codex plugin marketplace add tony/skills
```

Install the plugin:

```console
codex plugin add git-branch@skills
```

The skills below are written with Claude Code's leading slash. Codex uses
the same names without it, so `/git-branch:…` there is `git-branch:…`.

## Components

### `/git-branch:soft-reset-and-recommit` (skill)

Takes a branch of `wip` commits, or one commit doing five things, and
turns it into a series a reviewer can read.

1. **Gathers intent first** — the original commit messages, trailers,
   the pull request body and its review threads, linked tickets, and
   optionally the session that wrote the code. The collapse destroys
   the original boundaries, so everything is read before anything is
   touched.
2. **Resolves the base and refuses** — one merge base or stop; the
   parent tip for a stacked branch, never trunk; and a halt on a dirty
   tree, an operation in progress, merge commits in the range, or a
   branch someone else has pushed to.
3. **Discovers the commit format** — declared in `AGENTS.md`,
   `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or a commitlint config, otherwise mined from the
   project's own history at the fork point. Reports `mixed` and asks
   rather than guessing.
4. **Plans the series and waits** — every proposed commit, its
   contents, and the intent behind it, presented in plan mode for
   approval before anything destructive happens.
5. **Backs up, collapses, rebuilds** — a backup branch, then
   `git reset --soft`, then one atomic commit at a time, preserving
   original authorship and carrying trailers forward.
6. **Proves it** — `git diff --quiet` against the backup must exit 0,
   and every commit is gated in place through the project's own
   checks.

Pushing is always a separate decision the user makes.

### `/git-branch:redo-from-scratch` (skill)

For the other case: the branch's code is what is wrong. A proof of
concept that became the real thing, or an approach found halfway
through that the earlier code does not reflect.

1. **Establishes a contract before anything else** — trunk's tests,
   the tests this branch added, and their result right now. What
   passes is the specification. A branch with no tests stops here, and
   the skill offers to write characterization tests against the
   existing implementation first, so a spec exists before anything is
   discarded.
2. **Studies the branch into a coverage ledger** — behavior changes,
   tests, edge cases, workarounds, review requests, acceptance
   criteria, public surface, dependencies. The undocumented guards get
   the most attention, because a clean rewrite is what drops them.
3. **Rebuilds in a worktree, from the ledger** — not by reading the
   old implementation line by line, which reproduces the shape the
   rewrite was called in to replace. Offers a bakeoff when more than
   one approach is genuinely in contention.
4. **Verifies against the contract** — a test the rebuild cannot pass
   without editing is a decision surfaced to you, never a silent edit.
5. **Reconciles** — every ledger entry addressed or explicitly
   dropped, then the old-versus-new diff walked as review material
   rather than as a gate, since the code is supposed to differ.

The original branch is kept as the reference and the fallback.

### Which one

The net change is the difference. `soft-reset-and-recommit` guarantees
it is byte-identical and gates on that. `redo-from-scratch` expects it
to change, so it earns its safety from the test contract and the
ledger instead. That makes the second strictly riskier, and it is why
it refuses to start on a branch with no tests.

### The interactive-rebase toolkit

`references/rebase-todo.sh` drives `git rebase -i` from a shell with
no editor and no TTY. Both skills use it, and it works standalone.

Run it from anywhere — the examples below spell the path in full so
they can be pasted as-is. Inside a session `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
resolves to this plugin's directory; from a plain shell, substitute
wherever the plugin is installed.

Report any git operation in progress:

```console
sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/rebase-todo.sh status
```

Print the todo list for a range:

```console
sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/rebase-todo.sh show <base>
```

Replay the range from an edited plan:

```console
sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/rebase-todo.sh apply <base> plan.txt
```

Run a command after every commit, in place:

```console
sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/rebase-todo.sh verify <base> 'make test'
```

Fold pending `fixup!` and `amend!` commits:

```console
sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/rebase-todo.sh squash <base>
```

It refuses to run on a dirty tree or over an operation already in
progress, pins the three config settings that otherwise change the
todo format or hide dropped commits, and reports rather than hides a
rebase it left stopped.

## Relationship to the other git plugins

### Reach for `/git-branch:soft-reset-and-recommit` when

The branch's *content* is right and its *history* is wrong — commits
that mix concerns, say nothing, or do not survive review.

### Reach for `/pr:deslop` when

The commit messages need cleaning but the commit boundaries are fine.
It fixes messages through fixup commits and autosquash, and explicitly
does not split multi-topic commits — that gap is what this plugin
fills.

### Reach for `/rebase` when

The branch needs to move onto current trunk. That is a different
operation: neither skill here changes the base a branch sits on.

### Reach for `/commit` when

You are creating a new commit rather than rebuilding existing ones.

## Prerequisites

- **git** — 2.43 or newer for the verified behavior of `--keep-base`,
  `git restore`, and `--force-if-includes`.
- **gh** — to read the pull request, its review threads, and linked
  issues. Optional; the skill degrades to git-only sources.
- **uvx** — only for the optional prior-conversation layer.
