# package-updater

Update dependencies and toolchain pins across one repository or a whole
fleet. Check the supply-chain cooldown before calling anything current,
research each move against the vendor's own release notes, and land the
toolchain, the named bumps, the bulk lockfile refresh and their fallout
as separate commits.

## Installation

In Claude Code, add the marketplace:

```console
/plugin marketplace add tony/ai-workflow-plugins
```

Install the plugin:

```console
/plugin install package-updater@ai-workflow-plugins
```

In Codex, add the marketplace:

```console
codex plugin marketplace add tony/ai-workflow-plugins
```

Install the plugin:

```console
codex plugin add package-updater@ai-workflow-plugins
```

The skills below are written with Claude Code's leading slash. Codex uses
the same names without it, so `/package-updater:…` there is `package-updater:…`.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/package-updater:update` | Find everything outdated in scope and bring it current, in commit order |
| `/package-updater:update-package <name>` | Take one named package to a target version everywhere it is pinned |
| `/package-updater:update-toolchain [tool]` | Move `.tool-versions`, `.nvmrc`, `packageManager` and `engines`, one tool per commit |

"What's out of date?" → `update`, which also takes `--audit-only` to
report without writing. One package you already know is stale →
`update-package`. A runtime or CLI tool → `update-toolchain`.

All three default to the current repository and to committing on the
default branch. `--branch <name>` works on a branch, `--pr` opens a pull
request from it, `--no-push` commits locally and stops. All three also
widen scope the same way: `--root <dir>` sweeps every repository beneath
a directory, `--repo <path|slug>` names individual ones, and
`--owner <name>` keeps only those belonging to given accounts.

`update --issue github|linear` files the audit before the work starts:
create the issue or card listing what is outstanding, derive the branch
name from it, then work on that branch.

## The four commit tracks

The plugin's central claim is that a dependency commit's value is its
reasoning, and reasoning does not survive bundling. So the work splits:

1. **Toolchain and runtime** — one tool per commit, even when one edit
   to `.tool-versions` moves three. Every release in the span is linked,
   because the intermediate ones are where regressions hide.
2. **Package manager and engines** — `packageManager` and `engines` pin
   the toolchain despite living in a manifest, so they never ride along
   with a dependency bump.
3. **Named package bumps** — one per package, or per release train when
   the body can say why they are coupled. `why:` then `what:`, with
   verified links.
4. **Bulk lockfile refresh** — everything routine, in one commit, with
   an **empty body**. The lockfile diff already says what moved, and a
   generated list of package names buries the commits that carry real
   reasoning.

Fallout lands after, as its own commit: a `biome.jsonc` schema bump, a
snapshot regeneration, a framework migration.

## Supply-chain cooldown

A cooldown makes the resolver ignore releases younger than a threshold.
The plugin checks for one before reporting anything as current, because
a gated release looks identical to no release at all.

The keys are not interchangeable: uv reads `exclude-newer` as a
duration, pnpm reads `minimumReleaseAge` in **minutes** from
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and npm reads `min-release-age` in **days** from
`.npmrc` — a key pnpm ignores entirely.

Waiting out the window is the default. An exemption is narrow,
annotated, committed alone, and reverted when the block lapses.

## Whose repositories get committed to

A `--root` sweep walks into worktrees, forks, vendored clones and
upstream projects kept around for reference — all of which look like git
repositories. The plugin asks the forge for `isFork` and
`viewerPermission` before touching any of them, skips forks regardless
of who owns them, and **stops to ask when the signals disagree** rather
than inferring ownership from an account name.

That last case is not hypothetical: one repo here is owned outright by
the user, yet its last ten commits on trunk are all from a coding agent,
so authorship alone would have excluded it. Another sits under an
organisation the user only contributes to, where the account name alone
would have included it.

## What one discovery tool misses

`ncu` reads `package.json`, so a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` catalog entry, an
`overrides` block, or a package held in `.ncurc` never appears in its
report. A clean run is not a current tree.

## Holds

A `reject` entry in `.ncurc` is a decision to stay behind on purpose,
and every one has a condition that ends it. The plugin audits them on
every sweep: it releases the holds whose condition has been met, and
surfaces the ones whose reason is no longer recoverable rather than
quietly dropping them.

Two things make this easy to get wrong. `.ncurc` resolves next to the
*package file*, so a workspace member can hold a package its siblings
track and a root-only scan will miss it. And `ncu` rejects unknown keys,
so a `$comment` explaining the hold breaks the tool rather than
documenting it — the commit message is the only durable record, which is
why the grammar names the condition in the subject:

```
.ncurc: Ignore `@biomejs/biome` 2.3.5 -> 2.3.6 until they fix class methods
```

```
.ncurc: Unignore `@biomejs/biome` (2.3.7 fixed issue)
```

## What this plugin does not do

Three dependency classes belong to sibling plugins, which own the
research that makes them safe. This plugin reports them as findings and
names the command:

- GitHub Actions `uses:` pins → `/github-actions:update-actions`
- ruff's floor and the rule fallout it produces → `/ruff:bump`
- Terraform versions, providers and lock files → `/terraform:bump-provider`

## Components

**Commands** — `update`, `update-package`, `update-toolchain`.

**Skill** — `updating-packages`, the phase structure the commands share:
inventory, discovery, research, plan gate, land in order, verify,
report.

**References** — `repo-scope.md` (which repositories are yours to commit
to, and when to stop and ask), `ecosystems.md` (detection, discovery and apply
commands, cooldown configuration), `commit-conventions.md` (subject
grammar, body anatomy, the empty-body rule), `upstream-links.md` (which
URLs each tool's bump cites), `follow-ups.md` (which bumps need a second
commit, and how to declare a knowingly-red intermediate), `holds.md`
(staying behind on purpose, and releasing the hold when its condition is
met).

## Prerequisites

`git`, and whichever ecosystem tooling the repositories actually use —
`uv`, `pnpm`, `ncu`, `npm`, `cargo`, `go`, `mise`. The plugin detects
what is present rather than assuming a stack. `gh` is needed for issue
creation and for verifying release URLs on GitHub.
