# 03-execute

Land the plan as separate, verified commits. This is the **only** phase that edits
the suite and writes history.

`$ARGUMENTS` may pass `--from=<index>` to start at a specific plan item,
`--dry-run` to apply and verify without committing (reverting after each), and
`--memory-dir` to override the memory location.

## Step 1: Preconditions

Read `plan.json`, `baseline.json`, and the project quality-check + test commands.
Refuse to run unless:

- the working tree is **clean** (one commit per speedup needs a clean base), and
- `plan.json` exists and was approved in `/pytest-optimizer:02-plan`.

Read `execution-log.json` if present and resume from `last_applied_index + 1`
(or `--from`). Never re-apply an item that already has a `commit_sha`.

## Step 2: Apply each item in order

For each plan item not yet applied:

1. **Apply** the single change (the heuristic's action). Touch only the files the
   plan lists for this item.
2. **Verify green.** Run the project quality checks (formatter, linter, type
   checker) and the test suite, as declared in the project's `AGENTS.md`/
   `CLAUDE.md` — substitute that command wherever this file writes `pytest`:

   ```bash
   pytest -p no:cacheprovider -q
   ```

   For a typing/parametrize item (goals 9, 10), the type checker must cover
   `tests/` and pass.
3. **On success** — commit this change **alone** with the drafted why/what
   message (`../../templates/commit-message.tmpl`, adapted to
   the target project's convention). Record the `commit_sha`.
4. **On failure** — revert the change (`git checkout -- <files>` / discard), mark
   the item `skipped` with the reason. Do not let one failure block the rest.
5. **Checkpoint** — append the item's outcome to `execution-log.json` immediately
   and update `state.json` (`phase=execute`, `last_applied_index`). This makes the
   loop crash-safe: a re-run continues from the last durable checkpoint.

Under `--dry-run`, perform 1–2 then revert and log the verify result without
committing.

## Step 3: Re-measure and report

After the plan is exhausted, re-run the baseline measurement (serial, cache
disabled, N runs) and compare total wall-time to `baseline.json`. Emit the
`03-execute` sections from `../../references/output-contract.md`:
hero block, then `## Applied` (commit SHAs + measured verify), `## Skipped`
(revert reasons), `## Result` (post-suite wall-time vs baseline, total recovered).

## Step 4: Offer another pass

Close with an `AskUserQuestion` panel: re-scan for a second pass (the suite is now
leaner, so new candidates may surface), scaffold the opt-in cache/timing plugin,
or stop. Re-scanning restarts the loop at `/pytest-optimizer:00-scan` with a fresh
baseline.
