  "optimize the test suite", "find slow fixtures", "my fixtures are slow", "which
  fixtures are unused", "the test suite takes too long", or "parallelize my
  tests". Runs a resumable four-phase pipeline (scan, benchmark, plan, execute)

# pytest-optimizer

Profile a pytest suite, find **safe** speedups, and apply each one as its own
verified commit — through a resumable, idempotent four-phase loop.

The core discipline: **measure before you mutate, and prove a speedup against the
project's own timing noise before you trust it.** A theoretically great change
whose measured delta falls inside the noise band is worth nothing and is never
committed.

`$ARGUMENTS` may name a test path or marker to scope the run, a `--phase` to jump
to, `--force` to ignore idempotency tokens and re-run, and `--memory-dir` to
override where durable state is written.

## The loop

```
00-scan  ->  01-benchmark  ->  02-plan  ->  03-execute  ->  (re-scan)
```

Each phase is a separate command that reads and writes durable JSON under the
resolved memory directory. Re-running the whole skill resumes at the first
incomplete phase. After `03-execute`, re-scanning measures the new baseline and
the loop can continue until no candidate clears the rubric.

| Phase | Command | Reads | Writes |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `/pytest-optimizer:00-scan` | `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, prior `state.json` | `baseline.json`, `capabilities.json`, `hypotheses.json` |
| 2 | `/pytest-optimizer:01-benchmark` | `baseline.json`, `hypotheses.json` | `benchmarks.json` |
| 3 | `/pytest-optimizer:02-plan` | `benchmarks.json`, `baseline.json` | `plan.json` |
| 4 | `/pytest-optimizer:03-execute` | `plan.json`, `baseline.json` | `execution-log.json` + commits |

## Step 1: Detect preferred tools and the project test command

Check for the user's preferred search tools, then read the project's own test and
quality-check commands. **Never hardcode the runner** — `pytest`, `uv run`, `tox`,
`nox`, and `hatch` are all valid and the project declares which it uses.

```bash
for tool in rg ag fd jq uv uvx; do command -v "$tool" >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "$tool:available" || echo "$tool:missing"; done
```

Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `justfile`, `tox.ini`, and `pyproject.toml` to
discover the canonical commands for running the suite, the formatter, the linter,
and the type checker. Record the test command verbatim; every phase reuses it.

## Step 2: Detect pytest capabilities (version gating)

The toolbox depends on the installed pytest and plugins. Probe once and persist
the result, so later phases use only features that exist.

```bash
python -c "import pytest; print(pytest.__version__)"
```

```bash
pytest --help 2>/dev/null | rg -- '--durations-min|--import-mode|--dist|--sw-reset' || true
```

Resolve each feature against `../../references/version-matrix.md`
(min version, detection probe, and graceful fallback). For example: pre-6.1 pytest
has no `--durations-min` (post-filter rows yourself); `--dist=loadgroup` needs
`pytest-xdist >= 2.5`; the `Stash` API needs pytest >= 7.0 (else use
`config.cache`). Write the resolved matrix to `capabilities.json`.

## Step 3: Resolve the memory directory

Follow `../../references/memory-schema.md`. Prefer
`.pytest-optimizer/` at the repo root and add it to `.gitignore` idempotently. If
the tree is read-only or the user declines an in-tree directory, fall back to the
XDG cache path. Record the chosen path in `state.json` so all four phases agree.

## Orchestration Plan

Before any measurement or edit, present a plan and get approval.

1. **Enter plan mode.** In Claude Code call `EnterPlanMode`. In Cursor/Codex/Gemini
   use `/plan` or `Shift+Tab`. If plan mode is unavailable, the phase structure
   below still forces analysis before any write.
2. **The orchestration plan must state:**
   - the resolved test command and quality-check commands (from Step 1);
   - the detected pytest + plugin versions and which capabilities are gated off
     (from Step 2);
   - the resolved memory directory and whether `.gitignore` will be touched;
   - which phase the run will start at (fresh `00-scan`, or resume), and the
     scope (`$ARGUMENTS` path/marker, or the whole suite);
   - that `00-scan` and `02-plan` only read and write JSON memory — no suite edits —
     and that suite edits happen only in `03-execute`, one commit per speedup,
     each green-verified.
3. **Present the plan and wait for approval.** Let the user narrow scope, exclude
   risky heuristics, or cap the number of commits.
4. **Exit plan mode** before running any phase.

## Step 4: Run the phases

Route to the four commands in order, honoring `--phase` and resume state. Each
command embeds its own detailed procedure; this skill only sequences them and
carries the shared context (test command, capabilities, memory dir).

- **`00-scan`** establishes the baseline (median + MAD noise band over N serial,
  cache-disabled runs), profiles slowest tests (`call` rows) and fixture
  setup/teardown (`setup`/`teardown` rows), and runs the static detectors. It
  emits `hypotheses.json`: candidate speedups, each tagged with a heuristic id
  (`H01`–`H44`) and the goal it addresses.
- **`01-benchmark`** applies each hypothesis in isolation on a throwaway working
  copy, re-measures vs the noise band, and runs the safety gates (order
  independence, collection determinism, green re-run). Within-noise or
  gate-failing candidates are rejected with a reason.
- **`02-plan`** scores the survivors with the rubric
  (`../../references/scoring-rubric.md`), drops anything below the
  safety gate, orders the rest (typing and safety-gate fixes first; scope and
  consolidation before parallelism), and drafts one commit per speedup.
- **`03-execute`** applies the plan one item at a time: edit, run the project
  quality checks + suite, commit alone on green (why/what message), revert and
  skip on failure. It checkpoints after every item and resumes from the last
  applied index.

## Step 5: Report and decide whether to loop again

After `03-execute`, re-measure total wall-time against `baseline.json` and present
the result using the shared output contract
(`../../references/output-contract.md`): a hero block, the
applied/skipped speedups with their measured deltas, and an `AskUserQuestion`
next-step panel (re-scan for a second pass, scaffold the opt-in cache/plugin, or
stop).

## Opt-in scaffolds

When profiling shows it would help, offer (never impose) to generate a
project-owned, gitignored helper:

- A `pytest11` timing plugin (`templates/pytest_optimizer_plugin.py`) that wraps
  `pytest_fixture_setup` to attribute setup cost to the **individual** fixture —
  the one thing pytest core cannot do, since a `setup` duration row is the whole
  setup chain for an item.
- A `config.cache` memoization snippet (`templates/conftest_cache_snippet.py`)
  with an invalidation token and an xdist write-guard, for expensive build
  artifacts recomputed every run.

Generate only on explicit confirmation; gitignore the output unless the user
chooses to commit it.

## Graceful degradation

- **No plan mode** — keep the phase order; never touch the working tree during
  `00-scan`, `01-benchmark`, or `02-plan` (`01-benchmark` measures only on an
  isolated throwaway copy).
- **Old pytest** — gate features via the version matrix; widen the noise band when
  duration precision is coarser (pre-6.0 used `time.time()`, not `perf_counter`).
- **No xdist / randomly / deadfixtures** — fall back to serial runs, manual
  reversed-order isolation checks, and the built-in `--fixtures` vs
  `--fixtures-per-test` diff.
- **Dirty working tree** — refuse to run `03-execute` until clean (one commit per
  speedup requires a clean base); `00-scan` and `01-benchmark` leave the working
  tree untouched (`01-benchmark` works on an isolated copy) and may run anyway.
