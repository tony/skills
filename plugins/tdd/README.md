# tdd

TDD bug-fix workflow: reproduce bugs as failing tests, determine root cause,
fix, and verify.

## Installation

In Claude Code, add the marketplace:

```console
/plugin marketplace add tony/skills
```

Install the plugin:

```console
/plugin install tdd@skills
```

In Codex, add the marketplace:

```console
codex plugin marketplace add tony/skills
```

Install the plugin:

```console
codex plugin add tdd@skills
```

The skills below are written with Claude Code's leading slash. Codex uses
the same names without it, so `/tdd:…` there is `tdd:…`.

## Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/tdd:fix` | Standard xfail-driven TDD bug-fix loop |
| `/tdd:xfail` | Hermetic xfail workflow with diff gates, mock contamination guards, and CI checkpoints |

## `/tdd:fix` — 6-Phase Workflow

1. **Understand the bug** — Parse the report into symptom, expected behavior, trigger conditions
2. **Write a failing test** — Create an xfail-marked test that reproduces the bug
3. **Find root cause** — Trace from symptom to the exact code that needs to change
4. **Fix the bug** — Apply the minimal fix, confirm xfail flips to unexpected-pass
5. **Remove xfail and verify** — Convert to a regression test, run full quality gates
6. **Recovery loop** — If the fix doesn't work, diagnose and retry (up to 3 attempts)

Each phase produces a separate, atomic commit — the xfail test, the fix, and the xfail removal.

## Supported Test Frameworks

The command adapts to the project's test framework using the appropriate expected-failure mechanism:

| Framework | xfail mechanism |
|-----------|----------------|
| pytest (Python) | `@pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True)` |
| Jest (JavaScript/TypeScript) | `it.failing('...')` |
| Rust `#[test]` | `#[should_panic]` or `#[ignore]` |
| Go `testing` | `t.Skip("known bug: ...")` |

For other frameworks, the command uses whatever skip/pending/expected-failure mechanism is available.

## Quality Gate Discovery

The command reads AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md to discover the project's quality gates (test runner, linter, formatter, type checker). All gates must pass before each commit.

## `/tdd:xfail` — Hermetic Reproduction Protocol

A strict variant of the TDD workflow that enforces proof at every phase boundary:

1. **Reproduce** — Write a test with `strict=True` xfail; confirm it xfails
2. **Verify reproduction** — Temporarily remove xfail, confirm the test fails for the right reason (not mock contamination)
3. **Apply fix** — Source code only, zero test file changes; xfail now XPASSes
4. **Verify isolation** — Stash the fix, confirm the bug returns; pop, confirm it's gone
5. **Remove xfail** — Test file only, zero source changes; test passes normally
6. **Final verification** — Full suite green, three commits with correct file separation

Each commit passes a `git diff --stat` gate ensuring test-only and source-only commits stay separated. The stash round-trip in step 4 proves the fix is what resolved the test.

## Cross-Dependency Bugs

When a bug spans this project and a dependency, the command handles both:
1. Fix the dependency first
2. Verify the dependency's tests pass
3. Configure the local dependency for development
4. Then fix and test in this project

## Prerequisites

- **git** — for atomic commits at each phase
- A test framework supported by the project
- Quality gate commands defined in AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md

## Language-Agnostic Design

Test conventions, quality gates, and commit formats are all discovered from AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md at runtime. The command works with any language or test framework.
