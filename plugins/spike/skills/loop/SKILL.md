  Use when one spike will not settle a design and the work needs
  repeated contact with real code — probe, bake off the approaches the
  probe's stumbling blocks put in doubt, graft the runners-up, probe
  again, and stop when nothing new fights back. Triggers on phrases
  like "rinse and repeat", "spike then bakeoff then spike again",
  "keep spiking until it's right", "iterate until the design settles",
  "converge on an approach", "prove it out then rewrite it from
  scratch", or a port or rewrite whose shape is not yet known. Keeps a
  ledger of stumbling blocks and locked decisions outside the working
  tree, produces zero commits across every round, and ends by handing
  that ledger to a clean rewrite or to a commit-by-commit landing plan.

# `/spike:loop`

Convergence harness. `/spike:probe` answers "does this path work?".
`/spike:bakeoff` answers "which path is best?". Neither answers "what
is the right design?" — that only emerges from hitting real code
several times and watching which parts keep fighting back. The loop
runs both in rounds until the design stops resisting.

This skill is invoked by name, never routed to on the model's
initiative: it runs multiple mutating rounds and (in `--replay`)
creates commits, so it must be user-explicit, not router-inferred.

## Core thesis

Across rounds the code is disposable and **the ledger is the
product**. Each round throws away its implementation and keeps what it
learned: which approaches the code rejected, which decisions are now
settled, which questions are still open.

A loop is worth running when the shape of the answer is unknown — a
port to another language, an API whose ergonomics only show up in use,
a subsystem where the first sketch is expected to be wrong. When one
approach is already clear, use `/spike:probe`. When two or three named
approaches compete once, use `/spike:bakeoff`.

## The Iron Rule

```
EVERY ROUND PRODUCES ZERO COMMITS
```

Inherited whole from `/spike:probe`, including its rationalization
table, and unchanged by round count: five rounds of exploration is
five times the reason not to put it in history. Rounds end in stashes;
commits happen only in `--replay`, after the final plan is approved.

**Red flag** unique to this skill: "round 3 is basically final, commit
it as a checkpoint so round 4 has a base." Round 4 starts from the
stash, and the ledger is the base.

## The ledger

One markdown file, written outside the working tree:

```
git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir
```

The ledger lives at `<that path>/spike/<goal-slug>.md`. That location
is load-bearing, not a preference: a ledger kept in the working tree
gets swallowed by the round's own `git stash push -u`, erased by
`git clean -xdf`, and shows up as an untracked file in every
`git status` the user reads. The common dir also resolves to the same
absolute path from every bakeoff worktree, so contenders and the main
checkout write to one file.

Announce the path in the Phase 1 brief. An existing ledger for the same
goal is resumed, not overwritten — a loop interrupted by a context
compaction or a closed session picks up from its last round.

Each round appends one section:

- **Probed** — what this round built, and its stash SHA.
- **Stumbling blocks** — what fought back, per `/spike:probe`'s
  definition. New ones only; repeats are marked as repeats.
- **Bakeoff** — contenders, winner, why, and which grafts were taken
  (omit when no bakeoff ran this round).
- **Locked** — decisions that will not be revisited, with the evidence
  that settled them.
- **Open** — questions carried into the next round.

Keep every entry to a line or two. The ledger is read by the next
round and by the final rewrite; it is not a transcript.

## `$ARGUMENTS` contract

Non-flag text is the goal, resolved by the same ladder as
`/spike:probe` — typed goal wins, empty mines the conversation,
provenance recorded in the brief.

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--rounds=<n>` | 3 | Cap on the rounds the loop runs on its own. It may stop earlier by converging; only an explicit choice from the closing panel takes it further. |
| `--replay` | off | At Phase 4, land the approved plan immediately instead of stopping at the panel, following `/spike:probe` Phase 6. Never applies to a round. |

## Phase 0: Situational awareness

`/spike:probe` Phase 0 once for the whole loop — conventions files, the
five gate buckets and CI split per
`../../references/verification-gates.md`, dirty-tree halt — plus:

1. Resolve the ledger path and read it if it already exists.
2. Confirm `git worktree` is usable, since any round may call a
   bakeoff.

## Phase 1: Orchestration plan

Enter plan mode if the host supports it (Claude Code: `EnterPlanMode`;
Cursor / Codex / Gemini: `/plan` or `Shift+Tab`) and present the
**loop brief**:

1. The goal, one line, with provenance.
2. What "converged" means for this goal — the demo or property the
   final design must satisfy, not just the first round's smoke check.
3. The round cap, and any rounds already in the ledger.
4. Discovered gate commands and the local-vs-CI split.
5. The ledger path.
6. The intended exit: clean rewrite, or landing plan.

Wait for approval, then exit plan mode. If plan mode is unavailable,
present the brief inline and proceed on confirmation. In a
non-interactive run, record the brief and proceed.

## Phase 2: A round

Repeat until Phase 3 says stop. Each round:

1. **Probe.** Follow `/spike:probe` Phases 2 through 4 against the goal
   as sharpened by the ledger's open questions: shortest path to
   proven, cheapest verification signal, `SPIKE:` markers, stumbling
   blocks, the exit gate, and a stash with a recorded SHA. A round
   borrows those phases, it does not invoke the whole skill — probe's
   Phase 0 already ran once in Phase 0 above, its Phase 1 brief is the
   loop brief you already approved, and its plan and replay phases
   belong to the loop's exit. This is also why `--replay` never
   reaches a round.
2. **Branch on what fought back.** A stumbling block that admits two
   or more genuinely different resolutions is what `/spike:bakeoff`
   exists for — run it on those resolutions as the contender list. A
   stumbling block with one obvious fix is not a bakeoff; fold it into
   the next probe.
3. **Re-probe the graft.** Grafts leave a bakeoff unproven in
   combination. When a round takes them, the loop seeds the next
   round's tree itself — apply the winner's stash, then the graft
   hunks — and that round probes from there, so the proving check runs
   on the tree actually chosen. Seeding is the loop's own step rather
   than a probe invocation, which is why probe's dirty-tree halt does
   not fire on a tree the loop deliberately built. A graft that fails
   the check is dropped and recorded as dropped.
4. **Record.** Append the round's ledger section before starting the
   next one. A round that ends without its ledger entry written did
   not happen — the next round has no other memory of it.

Except when carrying grafts, a round starts from a clean tree. What it
inherits from round N-1 is the ledger's locked decisions, not its code.

## Phase 3: Convergence test

Stop when any of these holds, and say which one in the report:

Test them in this order, because a repeats-only round satisfies more
than one:

- **Thrashing** — the round surfaced stumbling blocks, but every one
  was already recorded and decided in an earlier round. Repetition is
  evidence that more spiking cannot settle the question; stop and
  surface it rather than spending another round.
- **Converged** — the round surfaced no stumbling block at all.
- **Capped** — `--rounds` is exhausted. Report the still-open
  questions plainly; a capped loop is an honest partial result, not a
  failure to hide.

Otherwise start the next round from the ledger's open questions.

## Phase 4: Exit

The surviving artifacts are the ledger, the final round's stash SHA,
and every earlier round's stash SHA. Offer the two exits:

- **Clean rewrite** — hand the ledger to `git-branch:redo-from-scratch`
  when it is installed, which treats locked decisions as requirements
  and the final stash as reference. This is the right exit when the
  accumulated code carries the marks of rounds that were later
  abandoned.
- **Landing plan** — a commit-by-commit plan for the final stash, built
  as `/spike:probe` Phase 5, and landed under `--replay` as its
  Phase 6. This is the right exit when the last round's code is
  already what the design wants.

Recommend one and say why. Never drop earlier stashes — the ledger
cites them by SHA as the evidence for its locked decisions.

## Output contract

1. Hero block (1–3 lines): `✓ converged in <n> rounds` /
   `⚠ capped at <n> rounds` / `⚠ thrashing — stopped at round <n>` +
   the goal.
2. `## Rounds` — one block per round: what was probed, what fought
   back, bakeoff winner if any, what got locked.
3. `## Design` — the locked decisions as they now stand, read as a
   specification rather than a history. This is what the rewrite
   consumes.
4. `## Open` — questions the loop did not settle, and for a thrashing
   stop, why spiking cannot settle them.
5. `## Stashes` — table: round, stash message, **SHA**, restore
   command. Every round appears.
6. `## Next` — the recommended exit, and the landing plan when one was
   produced.
7. End with an `AskUserQuestion` panel: rewrite from the ledger / land
   the final stash / run another round / stop and keep the ledger —
   unless already in plan mode or `--replay` was given. In a
   non-interactive run, record the question and default to stopping
   with the ledger kept.
