## Skills

| Claude Code | Codex | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/pr` | `pr` | Generate a gold-standard PR description from branch diff |
| `/pr:refresh` | `pr:refresh` | Update an existing PR description to the branch's current net change, preserving structure and customizations |
| `/pr:recut` | `pr:recut` | Rewrite an existing PR description from scratch, carrying forward context that still matters |
| `/pr:merge-commit` | `pr:merge-commit` | Generate a gold-standard merge commit message from branch diff |
| `/pr:review` | `pr:review` | Review an existing PR description against gold-standard patterns |
| `/pr:deslop` | `pr:deslop` | Audit branch commits for AI slop / brittle counts / verbose messages and resolve via fixup commits with optional autosquash |

## How It Works

### `/pr` — Generate PR description

1. **Gather context** — collect branch diff, commit log, and file change summary
2. **Read conventions** — check AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md for PR description conventions and `.github/pull_request_template.md` for templates
3. **Draft description** — apply gold-standard patterns: bold impact labels, structured headings, comparison tables, verification commands, test plan checklists
4. **Present and create** — show the proposed title and body, then optionally create the PR via `gh pr create`

### `/pr:refresh` — Refresh an existing PR description

1. **Resolve the PR** — from the argument or the current branch; diff against the PR's actual base branch (stack-aware)
2. **Back up** — save the current body under `.git/pr-backups/` before any edit
3. **Map claims against the diff** — keep accurate content byte-for-byte, minimally rewrite stale claims, add missing changes to existing sections, ask before touching hand-written content it can't verify
4. **Present and apply** — show an old → new comparison, then apply via `gh pr edit` on approval

Content-only: structure, links, formatting, and customizations are preserved; restructuring is `/pr:recut`'s job.

### `/pr:recut` — Rewrite an existing PR description from scratch

1. **Resolve the PR and back up** — same stack-aware base detection and `.git/pr-backups/` backup as `/pr:refresh`
2. **Mine the old description** — inventory issue links, setup steps, screenshots, reviewer commitments, and other context not derivable from the diff; ask about anything unclear
3. **Resolve the template** — a template named in your message wins; otherwise the repo's PR template; otherwise gold-standard structure; ambiguity between candidates gets a question
4. **Draft, present, apply** — fresh gold-standard description of the current net change with carried-forward context woven in, applied via `gh pr edit` on approval, with dropped items listed for veto

### `/pr:merge-commit` — Generate merge commit message

1. **Gather context** — collect branch diff, commit log, and file change summary
2. **Read conventions** — check AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md for merge commit format preferences
3. **Draft message** — apply proportional patterns: title-only for small fixes, structured body with bold labels, arrow notation, breaking change sections, and cross-references for larger changes
4. **Present message** — show the complete merge commit message for the user to copy/paste into their merge workflow (GitHub merge button, `git merge --edit`, etc.)

### `/pr:review` — Review PR description

1. **Fetch the PR** — parse the argument for PR number/URL, or detect the current branch's PR
2. **Fetch the diff** — get the PR diff to judge proportionality
3. **Evaluate** — check structure, bold labels, tables, code blocks, test plan, design decisions, verification, before/after, and negative assertions
4. **Report** — list strengths, list specific improvements with concrete markdown suggestions

### `/pr:deslop` — Audit branch commits for slop and resolve

1. **Detect trunk and lock baseline** — resolve trunk to an absolute SHA, snapshot branch state, refuse on dirty tree / detached HEAD / in-progress rebase / merge commits with `--apply-rebase`
2. **Refuse pushed branches by default** — require `--force-rewrite-pushed` to rewrite published history
3. **Discover quality gates** — read `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` and merge formatter / linter / type-checker / test commands across files
4. **Calibrate tone against trunk** — read the last 50 commits on `origin/<trunk>` to demote false-positive Tier C signals
5. **Detect** — hybrid pass: regex first (deterministic), semantic sub-agent on flagged hunks (precise; skip with `--no-semantic`)
6. **Materialize a patch series** — write numbered patches plus `apply.sh` under `.git/deslop/<ts>-<pid>/` for review before any history rewrite
7. **Apply with confirmation** — backup branch + checkpointed `apply.sh` for fixup commits; with `--apply-rebase`, run `git rebase -i --autosquash` and run quality gates on touched files at each conflict pause

## Arguments

Generate a PR description with an optional hint:

```
/pr
/pr fixes the race condition in new_session
```

Refresh or recut an existing PR (defaults to the current branch's PR):

```
/pr:refresh
/pr:refresh #42
/pr:refresh the retry logic was dropped
/pr:recut
/pr:recut #42 use .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/feature.md
```

Generate a merge commit message with an optional hint:

```
/pr:merge-commit
/pr:merge-commit version bump
/pr:merge-commit breaking change in the session API
```

Review an existing PR:

```
/pr:review
/pr:review #42
/pr:review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42
```

Audit branch commits for slop:

```
/pr:deslop
/pr:deslop --apply-patches
/pr:deslop --apply-rebase --run-tests
/pr:deslop --message-only --budget=strict
/pr:deslop --force-rewrite-pushed --apply-rebase
```

The default mode is **audit-only** — patches are written under
`.git/deslop/<ts>-<pid>/` for review; nothing is applied. Use
`--apply-patches` to create fixup commits without rebasing, or
`--apply-rebase` to also run autosquash. See
`plugins/pr/skills/deslop/SKILL.md` for the full flag reference and
edge cases.

## Gold-Standard Patterns

The generated PR descriptions follow patterns extracted from high-quality open-source PRs:

- **`## Summary`** with bold impact labels opening each bullet
- **`## Changes by area`** with `###` sub-headings for multi-module changes
- **`## Design decisions`** with trade-off rationale
- **`## Verification`** with copyable `rg`/`grep` commands proving completeness
- **`## Test plan`** with `- [x]` checklists describing what is validated
- **Comparison tables** for renames, parameter maps, API pairs, environment matrices
- **Before/After** code blocks for behavioral changes
- **Negative assertions** proving unwanted patterns are fully removed

## PR Templates

`/pr` and `/pr:recut` resolve which template to draft against: a template named in your message wins, then the repository's PR template (all standard GitHub locations, including `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`), then the gold-standard structure. When several candidate templates are in play, they ask instead of guessing. `/pr:review` accepts a template named in your message as its evaluation baseline. `/pr:refresh` never applies templates — it preserves the description's existing structure.

## Safety

- Never force-pushes or runs destructive git commands
- Never pushes to main/master
- Always presents the description before creating the PR
- Review command never modifies the PR — only reports findings
- Refresh and recut back up the existing description under `.git/pr-backups/` before editing, and only edit after approval

## Prerequisites

- **git** — for diff and log operations
- **gh** — GitHub CLI for PR creation and fetching
