# Weave Architecture

Run an architecture/scaffolding task across independent adversarial workers, using host-native sub-agents by default or separate model CLIs when selected. Each worker uses an **isolated git worktree**. After all workers complete, **cherry-pick the best conventions, skills, agents, and scaffolding from each worker** into a single, coherent architecture. Unlike the `weave-execute` skill (which targets feature implementation), this command focuses on **project-level documentation, conventions, and structural artifacts**.

The architecture goal comes from `$ARGUMENTS`. If no arguments are provided, ask the user what they want scaffolded.

## Worker selection



Before any other unresolved configuration choice or operational step, read
`references/worker-backends.md`. Resolve
`worker_backend` from `--workers=subagents|model-clis` using that reference;
if the flag is absent, ask its worker question first.
If interactive choice is unavailable, honor its documented headless default.

The selected backend governs the whole session: dispatch, retry, judging,
refinement, artifacts, session metadata, and presentation. The shared reference
adapts provider-named examples across every later phase to that backend.

When `worker_backend == subagents`, use only the reference's native sub-agent
path. Skip every model-CLI detection, timeout question, timeout resolution,
retry, fallback, and dispatch instruction below. Every such instruction below
is conditional on `worker_backend == model-clis`.

---

## Phase 1: Gather Context

**Goal**: Understand the project's existing architecture and conventions.

1. **Read CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md** if present — existing conventions constrain all outputs.

2. **Scan for existing components**:
   - Skills (`skills/*/SKILL.md`)
   - Agents (`agents/*.md`)
   - Hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`)
   - MCP servers (`.mcp.json`)
   - LSP servers (`.lsp.json`)

3. **Determine trunk branch**:
   ```bash
   git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch'
   ```
   Fall back to `main`, then `master`, if detection fails.

4. **Record the current branch and commit**:

   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

   ```bash
   git rev-parse HEAD
   ```

   Store these — all worktrees branch from this point.

5. **Capture the architecture goal**: Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the goal. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user.

6. **Explore project structure**: Read files relevant to understanding the project's architecture — directory layout, module boundaries, test frameworks, CI configuration, build system. This context helps evaluate model outputs later.

---

## Phase 1b: Build Context Packet

After Phase 1 context gathering, assemble a structured context bundle that will be included verbatim in ALL model prompts. This ensures every model works from the same information.

Write to `$SESSION_DIR/context-packet.md` *(the actual file write happens after Session Directory Initialization in Phase 2 creates `$SESSION_DIR`)*:

1. **Conventions summary** — key rules from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md (max 50 lines). Focus on commit format, test patterns, code style, and quality gates relevant to the task.

2. **Repo state** — branch, HEAD ref, trunk branch, uncommitted changes summary:
   ```bash
   git status --short
   ```

3. **Changed files** — branch changes relative to trunk:
   ```bash
   git diff --stat origin/<trunk>...HEAD
   ```

4. **Relevant file list** — files matching task keywords discovered during Phase 1 exploration. Include paths only, not content.

5. **Key snippets** — critical function signatures, types, test patterns, or API contracts relevant to the task (max 200 lines). Prioritize interfaces over implementations.

6. **Known unknowns** — aspects of the task that need discovery during execution. List what the model should investigate.

**Size limit**: 400 lines total. Prioritize by task relevance. If the packet exceeds 400 lines, truncate the least relevant sections (snippets first, then file list).

**Usage in model prompts**:
- For the **Claude Task agent**: reference the file path (`$SESSION_DIR/context-packet.md`) — the agent reads it directly
- For **Antigravity and GPT sub-agents**: include the context packet content in the agent prompt, which the sub-agent then passes to the external CLI

For `architecture`, include conventions summary (existing CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md content), existing component inventory (skills, agents, hooks, MCP servers), and known unknowns about the architecture goal.

---

## Phase 2: Configuration and Model Detection

### Step 1: Parse Flags

Scan `$ARGUMENTS` for explicit flags anywhere in the text. Flags use `--name=value` syntax and are stripped from the prompt text before sending to models.

| Flag | Values | Default | Description |
|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--passes=N` | 1–5 | 1 | Number of synthesis passes |
| `--timeout=N\|none` | seconds or `none` | command-specific | Timeout for external model commands |
| `--mode=fast\|balanced\|deep` | mode preset | `balanced` | Execution mode preset |

**Mode presets** set default passes and timeout when not explicitly overridden:

| Mode | Passes | Timeout multiplier |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| `fast` | 1 | 0.5× default |
| `balanced` | 1 | 1× default |
| `deep` | 2 | 1.5× default |

**Backward compatibility**: Legacy trigger words are silently recognized as aliases:
- `multipass` (case-insensitive) → `--passes=2`
- `x<N>` (N = 2–5, regex `\bx([2-5])\b`) → `--passes=N`
- `timeout:<seconds>` → `--timeout=<seconds>`
- `timeout:none` → `--timeout=none`

Legacy triggers are scanned on the first and last line only (to avoid false positives in pasted content). Explicit `--` flags take priority over legacy triggers.

Values above 5 for `--passes` are capped at 5 with a note to the user.

**Config flags** (used in Step 2):
- `pass_count` = parsed pass count from `--passes`, mode preset, or legacy trigger. Null if not provided.
- `timeout_value` = parsed timeout from `--timeout`, mode preset, or legacy trigger. Null if not provided.

### Step 2: Interactive Configuration

**When flags are provided, skip the corresponding question.** When `--passes` is provided, skip the passes question. When `--timeout` is provided, skip the timeout question.

If `ask-user-choice` is unavailable (headless mode via `claude -p`), use `pass_count` value if set, otherwise default to 1 pass. Timeout uses `timeout_value` if set, otherwise the command's default timeout.

Use `ask-user-choice` to prompt the user for any unresolved settings:

**Question 1 — Passes** (skipped when `--passes` was provided):
- question: "How many synthesis passes? Multi-pass re-runs all models with prior results for deeper refinement."
- header: "Passes"
- When `pass_count` exists (from mode preset or legacy trigger), move the matching option first with "(Recommended)" suffix. Other options follow in ascending order.
- When `pass_count` is null, use default ordering:
  - "1 — single pass (Recommended)" — Run models once and synthesize. Sufficient for most tasks.
  - "2 — multipass" — One refinement round. Models see prior synthesis and can challenge or deepen it.
  - "3 — triple pass" — Two refinement rounds. Maximum depth, highest token usage.

**Question 2 — Timeout** (skipped when `--timeout` was provided):
- question: "Timeout for external model commands?"
- header: "Timeout"
- options:
  - "Default (1200s)" — Use this command's built-in default timeout.
  - "Quick — 600s" — For fast queries (0.5× default). May timeout on complex tasks.
  - "Long — 1800s" — For complex tasks (1.5× default). Higher wait on failures.
  - "None" — No timeout. Wait indefinitely for each model.

### Step 3: Detect Available Models

**Goal**: Check which AI CLI tools are installed locally.

Run these checks in parallel:

```bash
command -v agy >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "agy:available" || echo "agy:missing"
```

```bash
command -v gemini >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "gemini:available" || echo "gemini:missing"
```

```bash
command -v codex >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "codex:available" || echo "codex:missing"
```

```bash
command -v agent >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "agent:available" || echo "agent:missing"
```

#### Model resolution (priority order)

| Slot | Priority 1 (native) | Native model | Fallback chain | Agent model |
|------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------  |
| **Claude** | Always available (this agent) | — | — | — |
| **Antigravity** | `agy` binary | `Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)` | `gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview` → `agent --model gemini-3.1-pro` | `gemini-3.1-pro` |
| **GPT** | `codex` binary | (default) | `agent --model gpt-5.4-high` | `gpt-5.4-high` |

**Resolution logic** for each external slot:
1. Native CLI found → use it
2. Else next CLI in the fallback chain → use it (`agent` slots use the `--model` flag)
3. Else → slot unavailable, note in report

The **Antigravity** slot is Google's lane: `agy` (Antigravity) supersedes the standalone `gemini` CLI, which Google retires on 2026-06-18. `agy` has no native read-only mode, so read-only commands isolate it in a disposable git worktree (Repo Guard Layer 1; see `docs/repo-guard-protocol.md`).

Report which models will participate and which backend each uses.

### Step 4: Detect Timeout Command

```bash
command -v timeout >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "timeout:available" || { command -v gtimeout >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "gtimeout:available" || echo "timeout:none"; }
```

On Linux, `timeout` is available by default. On macOS, `gtimeout` is available
via GNU coreutils. If neither is found, run external commands without a timeout
prefix — time limits will not be enforced. Do not install packages automatically.

Store the resolved timeout command (`timeout`, `gtimeout`, or empty) for use in all subsequent CLI invocations. When constructing bash commands, replace `<timeout_cmd>` with the resolved command and `<timeout_seconds>` with the resolved value (from trigger parsing, interactive config, or the command's default). If no timeout command is available, omit the prefix entirely. When `--timeout=none` is configured (via flag or interactive selection), also omit `<timeout_cmd>` and `<timeout_seconds>` entirely — run external commands without any timeout prefix.

### Session Directory Initialization

#### Step 1: Resolve storage root

```bash
if [ -n "$AI_AIP_ROOT" ]; then
  AIP_ROOT="$AI_AIP_ROOT"
elif [ -n "$XDG_STATE_HOME" ]; then
  AIP_ROOT="$XDG_STATE_HOME/ai-aip"
elif [ "$(uname -s)" = "Darwin" ]; then
  AIP_ROOT="$HOME/Library/Application Support/ai-aip"
else
  AIP_ROOT="$HOME/.local/state/ai-aip"
fi
```

Create a `/tmp/ai-aip` symlink to the resolved root for backward compatibility (if `/tmp/ai-aip` doesn't already exist or isn't already correct):

```bash
ln -sfn "$AIP_ROOT" /tmp/ai-aip 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### Step 2: Compute repo identity

```bash
REPO_TOPLEVEL="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
```

```bash
REPO_SLUG="$(basename "$REPO_TOPLEVEL" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9._-]/-/g')"
```

```bash
REPO_ORIGIN="$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || true)"
```

```bash
if [ -n "$REPO_ORIGIN" ]; then
  REPO_KEY="${REPO_ORIGIN}|${REPO_SLUG}"
else
  REPO_KEY="$REPO_TOPLEVEL"
fi
```

```bash
if command -v sha256sum >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  REPO_ID="$(printf '%s' "$REPO_KEY" | sha256sum | cut -c1-12)"
else
  REPO_ID="$(printf '%s' "$REPO_KEY" | shasum -a 256 | cut -c1-12)"
fi
```

```bash
REPO_DIR="${REPO_SLUG}--${REPO_ID}"
```

#### Step 3: Generate session ID

```bash
SESSION_ID="$(date -u '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%SZ')-$$-$(head -c2 /dev/urandom | od -An -tx1 | tr -d ' ')"
```

#### Step 4: Create session directory

```bash
SESSION_DIR="$AIP_ROOT/repos/$REPO_DIR/sessions/architecture/$SESSION_ID"
```

Create the session directory tree:

```bash
mkdir -p -m 700 "$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/outputs" "$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/stderr"
```

```bash
mkdir -p -m 700 "$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/diffs" "$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/files"
```

#### Step 4b: Stash user changes

```bash
git stash --include-untracked -m "weave-architecture: user-changes stash"
```

#### Step 4c: Repo Guard — Capture Fingerprint

Capture the clean repository state after stashing. See
`docs/repo-guard-protocol.md` Layer 2 for the full protocol.

```bash
REPO_HEAD="$(git -C "$REPO_TOPLEVEL" rev-parse HEAD)"
```

```bash
REPO_FINGERPRINT="$(git -C "$REPO_TOPLEVEL" status --porcelain)"
```

Write `$SESSION_DIR/repo-fingerprint.txt` containing the HEAD ref and
status output. This fingerprint reflects the clean stashed state.

#### Step 5: Write `repo.json` (if missing)

If `$AIP_ROOT/repos/$REPO_DIR/repo.json` does not exist, write it with these contents:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "slug": "<REPO_SLUG>",
  "id": "<REPO_ID>",
  "toplevel": "<REPO_TOPLEVEL>",
  "origin": "<REPO_ORIGIN or null>"
}
```

#### Step 6: Write `session.json` (atomic replace)

Write to `$SESSION_DIR/session.json.tmp`, then `mv session.json.tmp session.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "session_id": "<SESSION_ID>",
  "command": "architecture",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "branch": "<current branch>",
  "ref": "<short SHA>",
  "worker_backend": "<subagents or model-clis>",
  "participants": ["<participant artifact ID>", "..."],
  "executors": {"<participant artifact ID>": "<executor>"},
  "completed_passes": 0,
  "prompt_summary": "<first 120 chars of user prompt>",
  "created_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "updated_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC>"
}
```

When `worker_backend == model-clis`, add a `"models"` array containing the
resolved model for each participant. Omit `"models"` when
`worker_backend == subagents`.

#### Step 7: Append `events.jsonl`

Append one event line to `$SESSION_DIR/events.jsonl`:

```json
{"event":"session_start","timestamp":"<ISO 8601 UTC>","command":"architecture","worker_backend":"<subagents or model-clis>","participants":["<participant artifact ID>","..."]}
```

#### Step 8: Write `metadata.md`

Write to `$SESSION_DIR/metadata.md` containing:
- Command name, start time, configured pass count
- Worker backend, participant artifact IDs, and executor mapping
- Resolved models only for `model-clis`, timeout setting when applicable
- Git branch (`git branch --show-current`), commit ref (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`)

Store `$SESSION_DIR` for use in all subsequent phases.

#### Step 9: Write Context Packet

Write the Context Packet built in Phase 1b to `$SESSION_DIR/context-packet.md`.

---

## Native mutating lifecycle

When `worker_backend == subagents`, this lifecycle replaces the
provider-specific worktree creation, dispatch, artifact capture, main-tree
reset, and provider cleanup instructions below. Keep the backend-independent
architecture rubric, blind judging, synthesis, and quality gates.

1. Create one dedicated branch and isolated worktree under
   `$SESSION_DIR/worktrees/<participant>` for each native participant. Base
   each tree on the captured clean baseline after the user's changes are
   stashed. No worker runs in the main checkout.
2. Dispatch the architecture WorkItem from
   `references/worker-backends.md` to a fresh role-matched sub-agent rooted in
   that participant's worktree. Persist its returned explanation as
   `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/outputs/<participant>.md`.
3. Capture each participant's binary diff, changed-file snapshots, and quality
   results under the existing `diffs/<participant>.patch`,
   `files/<participant>/`, and quality artifact paths. Build blind labels from
   participant IDs.
4. Keep each participant worktree through refinement. Redispatch a fresh
   role-matched sub-agent into the same worktree for later passes, then capture
   the new artifacts before judging.
5. Adopt the best architecture per file from participant patches and
   snapshots. The host applies the selected changes to the clean main checkout,
   integrates cross-file dependencies, and runs the final quality gates; no
   worker writes there.
6. After adoption artifacts are secured, cleanup only the exact
   session-scoped participant worktrees and branches, then restore the user's
   stash through the existing restoration step.

The Claude, Antigravity, and GPT paths below are used only when
`worker_backend == model-clis`.

---

## Phase 3: Create Isolated Worktrees

**Goal**: Set up an isolated git worktree for each available external model.

For each external model (Antigravity, GPT — Claude works in the main tree), first remove any stale worktree from a prior run:

```bash
git worktree remove "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-<model>" --force 2>/dev/null || true
```

Then create the fresh worktree:

```bash
git worktree add "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-<model>" -b weave/<model>/<timestamp>
```

Example:

```bash
git worktree add ../myproject-weave-agy -b weave/agy/20260208-143022
```

```bash
git worktree add ../myproject-weave-gpt -b weave/gpt/20260208-143022
```

Use the format `weave/<model>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>` for branch names.

---

## Phase 4: Run All Models in Parallel

**Goal**: Generate architecture artifacts in each model's isolated environment.

### Prompt Preparation

Each model receives a distinct evaluation lens to decorrelate outputs and reduce shared blind spots. The same context packet is included for all models, but a different role preamble is prepended to each prompt.

| Slot | Role | Bias | Preamble |
|------|------|------|----------|
| Claude | **Maintainer** | Conservative, convention-enforcing, minimal-change | "You are the Maintainer. Prioritize correctness, convention adherence, and minimal scope. Challenge any change that isn't strictly necessary. Enforce all project conventions from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md." |
| Antigravity | **Skeptic** | Challenge assumptions, find edge cases, question necessity | "You are the Skeptic. Challenge every assumption. Find edge cases, failure modes, and unstated requirements. Question whether the proposed approach is even the right one. Prioritize what could go wrong." |
| GPT | **Builder** | Pragmatic, shippable, favor simplicity over abstraction | "You are the Builder. Prioritize practical, shippable solutions. Favor simplicity over abstraction. Focus on what gets the job done with the least complexity. Call out over-engineering." |

Role preambles are prepended before the task-specific prompt and context packet. The role does not change the task — it changes the lens through which the model approaches it.

Include the context packet from Phase 1b. Write the prompt content to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/prompt.md` using the Write tool.

The architecture prompt should include:

> Generate project architecture artifacts for this codebase. Read existing AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md and project structure first.
>
> Goal: <user's architecture goal>
>
> Produce any/all of:
> - AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md updates (project conventions, quality gates, commit standards)
> - Skill definitions (skills/*/SKILL.md) for reusable AI workflows
> - Agent definitions (agents/*.md) for specialized sub-agents
> - Architecture decision records documenting key design choices
> - Example code demonstrating core patterns
> - Basic test harnesses verifying architectural invariants
> - Directory scaffolding for new components
>
> Follow existing project conventions. Each artifact should be a separate file in the appropriate location.

### Claude Implementation (main worktree)

Launch a Task agent with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` to generate artifacts in the main working tree:

**Prompt for the Claude agent**:
> Generate project architecture artifacts for this codebase. Read CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md for existing conventions and follow them strictly.
>
> Goal: <user's architecture goal>
>
> Produce any/all of: AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md updates, skill definitions (skills/*/SKILL.md), agent definitions (agents/*.md), architecture decision records, example code, basic test harnesses, directory scaffolding.
>
> Each artifact should be a separate file in the appropriate location. Follow all project conventions from AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md.

### Antigravity Implementation (sub-agent)

Launch a Task agent (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, `mode: "default"`) to execute the Antigravity (agy) model in its worktree. Include in the agent prompt: the resolved backend command and timeout from Phase 2, the `$SESSION_DIR` path, the pass number, the worktree path (`$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-agy`), and the task description with context.

> <architecture prompt from prompt.md>
>
> ---
> Additional instructions: Follow AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md conventions. Each artifact should be a separate file.

The agent must:

1. Read the prompt from `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/prompt.md`
2. Run the resolved Antigravity command in the worktree directory. agy writes directly inside its persistent per-model worktree, whose diff is harvested as the model's output:

   **Primary (`agy` CLI)**:
   ```bash
   (cd "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-agy" && <timeout_cmd> <timeout_seconds> agy --model "Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)" --add-dir "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-agy" --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "$(cat "$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/prompt.md")" </dev/null >"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/outputs/agy.md" 2>"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/stderr/agy.txt")
   ```

   **Fallback (`gemini` CLI)**:
   ```bash
   (cd "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-agy" && <timeout_cmd> <timeout_seconds> gemini -m gemini-3-pro-preview -y -p "$(cat "$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/prompt.md")" >"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/outputs/agy.md" 2>"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/stderr/agy.txt")
   ```

   **Fallback (`agent` CLI)**:
   ```bash
   (cd "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-agy" && <timeout_cmd> <timeout_seconds> agent -p -f --model gemini-3.1-pro "$(cat "$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/prompt.md")" >"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/outputs/agy.md" 2>>"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/stderr/agy.txt")
   ```

3. On failure: classify (timeout → retry with 1.5× timeout; rate-limit → retry after 10s; credit-exhausted → skip retry, escalate to the next backend immediately; crash → not retryable; empty → retry once), retry max once with same backend, then fall back down the chain (agy → gemini → agent) if a native CLI was used; if all are credit-exhausted or unavailable, use the lesser model (`Gemini 3.5 Flash (High)` via agy for Antigravity; gpt-5.4-mini via agent for GPT)
4. Return: exit code, elapsed time, retry count, output file path

### GPT Implementation (sub-agent)

Launch a Task agent (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, `mode: "default"`) to execute the GPT model in its worktree. Include in the agent prompt: the resolved backend command and timeout from Phase 2, the `$SESSION_DIR` path, the pass number, the worktree path (`$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-gpt`), and the task description with context.

> <architecture prompt from prompt.md>
>
> ---
> Additional instructions: Follow AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md conventions. Each artifact should be a separate file.

The agent must:

1. Read the prompt from `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/prompt.md`
2. Run the resolved GPT command in the worktree directory:

   **Native (`codex` CLI)**:
   ```bash
   (cd "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-gpt" && <timeout_cmd> <timeout_seconds> codex exec \
       --yolo \
       -c model_reasoning_effort=medium \
       "$(cat "$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/prompt.md")" >"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/outputs/gpt.md" 2>"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/stderr/gpt.txt")
   ```

   **Fallback (`agent` CLI)**:
   ```bash
   (cd "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-gpt" && <timeout_cmd> <timeout_seconds> agent -p -f --model gpt-5.4-high "$(cat "$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/prompt.md")" >"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/outputs/gpt.md" 2>>"$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/stderr/gpt.txt")
   ```

3. On failure: classify (timeout → retry with 1.5× timeout; rate-limit → retry after 10s; credit-exhausted → skip retry, escalate to agent CLI immediately; crash → not retryable; empty → retry once), retry max once with same backend, then fall back to agent CLI if native was used; if agent is also credit-exhausted or unavailable, use lesser model (`Gemini 3.5 Flash (High)` via agy for Antigravity; gpt-5.4-mini via agent for GPT)
4. Return: exit code, elapsed time, retry count, output file path

### Artifact Capture

After each model completes, persist its output to the session directory:

- **Claude**: Write the Task agent's response to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/outputs/claude.md`
- **Antigravity**: Written by the Antigravity sub-agent to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/outputs/agy.md`
- **GPT**: Written by the GPT sub-agent to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/outputs/gpt.md`

### Execution Strategy

- Launch all model agents in the same turn to execute simultaneously. If parallel dispatch is unavailable, launch sequentially — the synthesis phase handles partial results.
- Each sub-agent handles its own retry and fallback protocol internally (see steps 3-4 in each agent's instructions above).
- After all agents return, verify output files exist in `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/outputs/`.
- If a sub-agent reports failure after exhausting retries, mark that model as unavailable for this pass and include failure details in the report.
- Never block the entire workflow on a single model failure.

---

## Phase 5: Analyze All Architectures

**Goal**: Deep-compare every model's architecture artifacts to identify the best elements from each, using evidence-backed scoring.

### Step 1: Gather All Diffs

For each model that completed, stage all changes (including untracked files) before diffing so new files appear in the output:

**Claude** (main worktree):
```bash
git add -A
```

```bash
git diff HEAD
```

Unstage after capturing the diff to avoid side effects on the user's index:

```bash
git reset HEAD
```

**Repo Guard**: After unstaging, verify the main tree is clean (no leftover tracked changes from the Claude sub-agent). The `git reset HEAD` should leave the tree in its pre-execution state. If `git status --porcelain` shows unexpected changes, log a warning to `$SESSION_DIR/guard-events.jsonl`.

**External models** (worktrees):
```bash
git -C "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-<model>" add -A
```

```bash
git -C "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-<model>" diff HEAD
```

```bash
git -C "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-<model>" reset HEAD
```

Write diffs to: `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/diffs/claude.diff`, `agy.diff`, `gpt.diff`.

### Step 1b: Snapshot Changed Files

For each model, snapshot changed files into `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/files/<model>/` preserving repo-relative paths. Only new and modified files are snapshotted — deleted files appear in the diff only.

**Claude** (main worktree):
```bash
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d HEAD
```

Copy each file to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/files/claude/<filepath>`.

**External models** (worktrees):
```bash
git -C "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-<model>" diff --name-only --diff-filter=d HEAD
```

Copy each file from `$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-<model>/<filepath>` to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/files/<model>/<filepath>`.

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Architecture

For each model's output, run architecture-specific quality checks:

- **Convention completeness**: Does the AGENTS.md cover commit messages, testing, CI, code style, quality gates?
- **Skill quality**: Are skills well-scoped with clear descriptions, appropriate tool restrictions, and useful content?
- **Agent design**: Do agents have appropriate tool access, delegation patterns, and descriptive examples?
- **Architectural coherence**: Do all artifacts work together as a system?
- **Test harness utility**: Do tests verify meaningful invariants rather than trivial assertions?

Write results to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/quality-gates.md`.

### Step 3: Verify and Score per File

### Blind Judging Protocol

Before synthesis, strip model identity from responses to prevent brand bias during evaluation.

**Step 1: Randomize Labels**

Assign random labels (Response A, Response B, Response C) to the model outputs. Use a random permutation — do not always assign Claude to A. Record the mapping in `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/label-map.json`:

```json
{
  "A": "<model>",
  "B": "<model>",
  "C": "<model>"
}
```

**Step 2: Evaluate Blindly**

During scoring and adjudication (see Synthesis Protocol), refer to responses only by their labels (A/B/C). Do not consider which model produced which output.

**Step 3: Reveal After Scoring**

After all scoring and adjudication is complete, reveal the model identities in the attribution section of the final report. Include the label mapping so the user can trace which model produced which response.

**Limitation**: Claude is both participant and judge. True blindness is impossible for Claude's own output — it may recognize its own writing style. The blind labeling primarily prevents bias when evaluating external model outputs against each other.

### Synthesis Protocol

After collecting model outputs and applying blind labels, follow this evidence-backed synthesis protocol. Convergence mode for this command: **file-by-file**.

**Step 1: Verify Claims**

For each blinded response (A/B/C), check factual claims against the codebase:

- **File references**: Use `Glob` and `Read` to confirm referenced files exist
- **Function/API references**: Read the file and verify function signatures, class names, and API contracts match what the response claims
- **Convention claims**: Check against CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md — does the response correctly apply project rules?
- **Classify each claim**: `verified` (confirmed by reading code), `plausible-unverified` (reasonable but not checked), or `false` (contradicted by code)

Write the verification results to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/verification.md`.

**Step 2: Score with Rubric**

Rate each blinded response 0–10 per dimension using the General Rubric. Compute a weighted total for each response.

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Correctness | 3× | Verified claims, no hallucinations |
| Completeness | 2× | Covers all task aspects |
| Convention adherence | 2× | Follows CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md patterns |
| Risk awareness | 1× | Edge cases, failure modes identified |
| Scope discipline | 1× | Minimal unnecessary changes — higher is better |

Write scores to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/scores.md` in a table showing per-dimension scores and weighted totals for each label (A/B/C).

**Step 3: Adjudicate Conflicts**

Compare responses to identify:

- **Agreement points** — all responses concur on these → accept as foundation
- **Conflicts** — responses disagree → verify against the codebase, accept the one supported by evidence
- **Unresolvable conflicts** — cannot determine which is correct from code alone → note both positions with available evidence

**Step 4: Converge (File-by-File)**

For each modified file, select the best version based on per-file scores and verification results; integrate and fix cross-file consistency.

**Step 5: Critic**

Launch an independent Task agent (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`) to challenge the synthesized result:

> Review the following synthesis for errors. Your job is to BREAK it — find problems, not confirm it's good.
>
> Find: (1) remaining factual errors — file/function references that don't exist, (2) logical inconsistencies — steps that contradict each other, (3) missing edge cases — failure modes not addressed, (4) convention violations — rules from CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md not followed.
>
> Emit ONLY deltas: each issue found and its specific fix. Do not rewrite the entire synthesis.

Write the critic's findings to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/critic.md`. Incorporate valid findings into the final output — verify each critic finding against the codebase before accepting it.

For each file created or modified by any model:

1. **Read all versions** — the original from `git show HEAD:<filepath>` (if it existed), plus each model's version from `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/files/<model>/<filepath>`
2. **Verify claims** — check frontmatter validity, cross-references, tool names, and convention accuracy
3. **Score each version** using the general rubric dimensions (per file)
4. **Select the best version per file** — this may come from different models for different files

### Present the analysis

Read `references/present-results.md` and apply it with:

- `RESULT_KIND` = `architecture`
- `ARTIFACT_PATH` = `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/synthesis.md`
- `SESSION_DIR` = `$SESSION_DIR`
- `PASS_COUNT` = the resolved pass count
- `IN_PLAN_MODE` = false
- `WORKER_BACKEND` = `worker_backend`
- `PARTICIPANTS` = the successful participant artifact IDs
- `EXECUTORS` = the resolved participant artifact ID to executor mapping
- `MODELS` = resolved models when `worker_backend == model-clis`; otherwise null
- `LABEL_MAP_PATH` = `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/label-map.json`

After the reference returns, finalize the session per the existing
session finalization block.

After presenting the analysis, persist the synthesis:

- Write the file-by-file analysis to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-0001/synthesis.md`
- Update `session.json` via atomic replace: set `completed_passes` to `1`, `updated_at` to now. Append a `pass_complete` event to `events.jsonl`.

---

## Phase 6: Multi-Pass Refinement

If `pass_count` is 1, skip this phase.

For pass N >= 2, do NOT re-run the entire task. Instead, target only:

1. **Unresolved conflicts** from the prior pass's adjudication (Step 3)
2. **Critic findings** from the prior pass's critic (Step 5)
3. **Low-confidence scores** — any dimension scoring < 5 on any response

Construct refinement prompts that include ONLY these targeted items:

> The following issues remain from the prior pass. Address ONLY these items:
>
> **Unresolved conflicts**: [list from prior adjudication]
> **Critic findings**: [list from prior critic.md]
> **Low-confidence areas**: [dimensions/responses that scored < 5]
>
> For each item: provide your resolution with evidence (file paths, line numbers, code references).

After collecting targeted responses:
- Re-score only affected dimensions (not the full rubric)
- Re-adjudicate only the disputes targeted in this pass
- **Early-stop**: If no material delta between this pass and the prior pass (no scores changed by more than 1, no new conflicts identified), stop refinement early and report convergence

Write the conflict-only prompt to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-{N}/prompt.md`. Follow the same retry protocol and artifact capture as the initial pass.

For each pass from 2 to `pass_count`:

1. **Ask for user confirmation** before starting the next pass. Warn that each pass spawns external AI agents that may consume tokens billed to other provider accounts (Google, OpenAI, Cursor, etc.).

2. **Create the pass directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p -m 700 "$SESSION_DIR/pass-$(printf '%04d' $N)/outputs" "$SESSION_DIR/pass-$(printf '%04d' $N)/stderr" "$SESSION_DIR/pass-$(printf '%04d' $N)/diffs" "$SESSION_DIR/pass-$(printf '%04d' $N)/files"
   ```

3. **Clean up old worktrees and branches**, discard Claude's changes, create fresh worktrees with new timestamps.

4. **Construct conflict-only prompts** targeting low per-file scores, critic findings, and quality gate failures from the prior pass. For Claude, reference prior artifacts by path; for external models, inline them.

5. **Write the refinement prompt** to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-{N}/prompt.md` and re-run all models in parallel (same backends, same timeouts, same retry logic as Phase 4).

6. **Capture outputs** to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-{N}/outputs/<model>.md`.

7. **Re-analyze** following Phase 5 (including snapshots). Re-score only affected files/dimensions. Write diffs, quality gates, and synthesis to `$SESSION_DIR/pass-{N}/`.

8. **Early-stop** if no material delta from prior pass. **Update session**: set `completed_passes` to N in `session.json`, append `pass_complete` to `events.jsonl`.

Present the final-pass analysis and wait for user confirmation before synthesizing.

---

## Phase 7: Synthesize the Best Architecture

**Goal**: Combine the best architecture artifacts from all models into the main working tree.

### Step 1: Start Fresh

Discard Claude's modifications to start from a clean state (user changes were already stashed in Phase 2, Step 4b). This must remove both tracked changes and untracked files created by the model:

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD
```

```bash
git clean -fd
```

### Step 2: Apply Best-of-Breed Changes

For each file, apply the best model's version from the file snapshots:

- Read the file from `$SESSION_DIR/pass-NNNN/files/<model>/<filepath>` (where NNNN is the final pass number)
- Use Edit/Write to apply those changes to the main tree
- Check the diffs for deleted files (lines starting with `deleted file mode` or `--- a/path` with `+++ /dev/null`) and `rm` them from the main tree

This reads from snapshots rather than worktrees, so synthesis works even if worktrees have been cleaned up during multi-pass refinement.

### Step 3: Integrate and Adjust

After applying best-of-breed artifacts:
1. **Verify cross-references** — ensure conventions reference correct test commands, skills reference correct tools, agents reference correct skills
2. **Fix inconsistencies** — naming, formatting, import paths between artifacts from different models
3. **Validate frontmatter** — ensure all skills have required `name` and `description`, agents have required `name` and `description`, commands have required `description`
4. **Ensure coherence** — all artifacts should work together as a system, not as isolated documents

### Step 4: Run Quality Gates

Validate architecture artifacts:
- Verify YAML frontmatter parses correctly in all skills, agents, and commands
- Check that skills/agents reference existing tools (not invented ones)
- Run the project's test suite if test harnesses were produced
- Verify AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md content is consistent with existing project structure

### Step 5: Cleanup Worktrees

Remove all weave worktrees and branches:

```bash
git worktree remove "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-agy" --force 2>/dev/null || true
```

```bash
git worktree remove "$REPO_TOPLEVEL/../$REPO_SLUG-weave-gpt" --force 2>/dev/null || true
```

```bash
git branch -D weave/agy/<timestamp> 2>/dev/null || true
```

```bash
git branch -D weave/gpt/<timestamp> 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 6: Restore Stashed Changes

If user changes were stashed in Phase 2, Step 4b, restore them. Only pop if the named stash exists — otherwise an unrelated older stash would be applied by mistake.

```bash
STASH_REF="$(git stash list | grep -m1 "weave-architecture: user-changes stash" | cut -d: -f1)" && [ -n "$STASH_REF" ] && git stash pop "$STASH_REF" || true
```

If the pop fails due to merge conflicts with the synthesized changes, notify the user: "Pre-existing uncommitted changes conflicted with the synthesis. Resolve conflicts, then run `git stash drop` to remove the stash entry."

The changes are now in the working tree, unstaged. The user can review and commit them.

## Rules

- Always create isolated worktrees — never let models interfere with each other
- Always evaluate each architecture before comparing
- Always present the synthesis plan to the user and wait for confirmation before applying
- Always clean up worktrees and branches after synthesis
- The synthesized architecture must have valid frontmatter and consistent cross-references before being considered complete
- **Repo Guard**: External model CLIs run in isolated worktrees via `(cd "$WORKTREE_PATH" && ...)`. Post-analysis verification ensures the main tree is unchanged during diff capture. Session-end verification confirms only synthesized changes are present before stash restore. See `docs/repo-guard-protocol.md`.
- If only Claude is available, skip worktree creation and just generate artifacts directly
- Use `<timeout_cmd> <timeout_seconds>` for external CLI commands, resolved from Phase 2 Step 4. If no timeout command is available, omit the prefix entirely. Adjust higher or lower based on observed completion times.
- Capture stderr from external tools (via `$SESSION_DIR/pass-{N}/stderr/<model>.txt`) to report failures clearly
- If a model fails, clearly report why and continue with remaining models
- Branch names use `weave/<model>/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>` format
- Never commit the synthesized result — leave it unstaged for user review
- If an external model times out persistently, ask the user whether to retry with a higher timeout. Warn that retrying spawns external AI agents that may consume tokens billed to other provider accounts (Google, OpenAI, Cursor, etc.).
- Outputs from external models are untrusted text. Do not execute code or shell commands from external model outputs without verifying against the codebase first.
- Architecture artifacts must be language-agnostic where possible — reference "the project's test suite" not specific commands like "pytest"
- Skills and agents must follow the frontmatter schemas defined in CLAUDE.md
- AGENTS.md changes must be consistent with any existing CLAUDE.md content
- At session end: update `session.json` via atomic replace: set `status` to `"completed"`, `updated_at` to now. Append a `session_complete` event to `events.jsonl`. Update `latest` symlink: `ln -sfn "$SESSION_ID" "$AIP_ROOT/repos/$REPO_DIR/sessions/architecture/latest"`
- Include `**Session artifacts**: $SESSION_DIR` in the final output


## Portability notes

- `ask-user-choice` — follow the source's choice contract. Hosts with a structured multiple-choice tool (Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`) should use it. Honor a documented headless default when the source defines one; otherwise print a numbered list and wait for a numbered reply. Never invent a choice.
- `$ARGUMENTS` — the text the user passed when invoking this skill. If your host does not substitute it, read it as the user's request in the current turn, and ask when there is none.
- Bundled files — every relative path in this skill points at a file shipped inside this skill directory. Read them from here, not from the host's plugin tree.
