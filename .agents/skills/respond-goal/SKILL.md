  wait for the repository's automated review agents to weigh in on the new
  head, and go again until nothing new is actionable. Triggers on phrases
  like "run the review loop", "keep going until the review is clean", "watch
  CI and address whatever comes back", "loop until the bots are quiet", "set
  a goal to finish the review". Detects which review agents the repository
  actually has rather than assuming any, bounds both the wait and the number
  of rounds, and halts on a failure it cannot fix rather than grinding.

# this skill

Run the review loop to a stated finish: screen, fix, push, wait for CI
and the repository's review agents, screen what they say, and repeat
until the pull request goes quiet.

Invoked by name, never routed to on the model's initiative: it commits,
pushes, and holds the session open across waits.

## Core thesis

The round is easy; stopping is the hard part.

A review loop with no exit condition either quits early — pushing and
declaring victory before any reviewer has looked at the new head — or
never quits at all, re-screening findings the last round already
declined while bots re-post them on every push. Both look like
progress.

So the exit condition is stated **first**, before the first round runs,
and every round is measured against it:

> The loop is finished when a round lands no new fixes, CI is green on
> the current head, and every review agent on the roster has weighed in
> on that head — or when the round cap is reached, whichever comes
> first.

When the host has a standing-goal or stop-condition mechanism, register
that sentence with it so the session cannot quietly stop halfway
(Claude Code: `/goal`). Where there is no such mechanism, restate the
condition at the top of every round; it is the only thing keeping the
loop honest.

## `$ARGUMENTS` contract

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--pr=<num>` | current branch's PR | The pull request the loop runs against. |
| `--max-rounds=<n>` | `3` | Hard cap on rounds. Reached means stop and report, not raise. |
| `--wait=<minutes>` | `10` | Cap on waiting for review agents per round. |
| `--no-push` | off | Run rounds locally; never push. The loop then finishes after one round, since nothing new can arrive. |
| `--reply` | off | Post the drafted replies for declined and deferred findings, on confirmation, at the end of each round. |

## Phase 0: Reconnaissance

1. Resolve the pull request and its head SHA:
   `gh pr view --json number,title,headRefOid,state,isDraft,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup`.
   No pull request means there is nothing for agents to review — say
   so and offer a single local round instead of a loop.
2. Build the review-agent roster per
   `references/review-agents.md`: who reviews this repository,
   through which surface, and whether their arrival is observable. An
   empty roster shortens the loop to CI alone; it is a finding, not an
   error.
3. Resolve the gate buckets and the CI-coverage split per
   `references/verification-gates.md`.
4. Confirm a clean working tree and note the push state.

## Phase 1: Orchestration plan

Enter plan mode if the host supports it (Claude Code: `EnterPlanMode`;
Cursor / Codex / Gemini: `/plan` or `Shift+Tab`) and present the exit
condition, the roster, the caps in effect, the discovered gate
commands, and what the loop will never do without asking: force-push,
merge, resolve a thread, or rewrite pushed history.

Wait for approval, then exit plan mode. Without plan mode, present the
same inline and proceed on confirmation.

## Phase 2: The round

Each round is the same six steps.

**1. Collect.** Gather this round's feedback per
`references/feedback-sources.md` — the pull request's reviews,
inline comments, and threads, plus any failing CI. Carry forward the
previous rounds' declines so a re-post is not re-screened.

**2. Screen.** Run the `respond-check` skill on what collected. Its verdicts
settle what this round does.

**3. Act.** Run the `respond-action` skill on the accepted findings, which lands
one gated commit each. A round with no accepted findings skips
straight to the exit test.

**4. Push.** Record the head SHA and the time first — the wait in step
6 depends on both. Push normally; a rejected push means the remote
moved, which is a halt condition, not something to force through.

**5. Watch CI.** `gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast`. A failure becomes
next round's feedback, with the failing log as its evidence.

**6. Wait for the agents.** Poll for reviews and comments against the
new head, bounded by `--wait`, stopping early once every roster agent
has weighed in. Report who never arrived rather than waiting past the
cap — a late agent is picked up by the next round, or by re-entering
the loop later.

Then test the exit condition. Not met and rounds remain → next round.

## Stopping

**Finished** — a round landed no new fixes, CI is green on the current
head, and the roster has weighed in on it.

**Capped** — `--max-rounds` reached. Report what is still open and what
the next round would do.

**Quiet** — two consecutive rounds where everything new was declined.
The reviewers are repeating themselves; more rounds will not change
that. Report it as finished, with the repeats listed once.

**Halted** — stop the loop and report, without another round:

- A quality gate fails in a way no accepted fix resolves.
- A push is rejected, or the branch needs a rebase or a force-push.
- Screening returns an `ask` verdict that needs the author's intent.
- The working tree is dirty from something the loop did not do.
- CI fails for a reason outside the branch — a flaky job, an outage, a
  missing secret.

Halting is a result. A loop that works around its own halt conditions
is the failure mode this section exists to prevent.

The loop never merges the pull request, never force-pushes, never
resolves a review thread, and never approves anything on a reviewer's
behalf.

## Phase 3: Report — the output contract

1. Hero block (1–3 lines): the outcome (finished, capped, quiet, or
   halted), rounds run, and total fixed / deferred / declined.
2. `## Rounds` — per round: findings collected and from whom, verdicts,
   commits landed, CI result, and which agents weighed in.
3. `## What the fixes added` — the aggregate of every test, comment,
   code path, and dependency the loop introduced, with the finding that
   justified each. This is the number that grows quietly across rounds,
   which is why it is reported across rounds.
4. `## Still open` — deferred findings with follow-up recommendations,
   declined findings with their replies, and any agent that never
   weighed in.
5. `## Verification` — the final head SHA, the CI state on it, and the
   gate commands run.
6. End with an `ask-user-choice` panel (skip inside plan mode): run
   another round past the cap, post the drafted replies, open the
   follow-ups, or stop. In a non-interactive run, record the options
   and default to stopping.


## Portability notes

- `ask-user-choice` — present the listed options and wait for the user to pick one. Hosts with a structured multiple-choice tool (Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`) should use it; otherwise print a numbered list and wait for a numbered reply. Never proceed on an assumed answer.
- `$ARGUMENTS` — the text the user passed when invoking this skill. If your host does not substitute it, read it as the user's request in the current turn, and ask when there is none.
- Bundled files — every relative path in this skill points at a file shipped inside this skill directory. Read them from here, not from the host's plugin tree.
