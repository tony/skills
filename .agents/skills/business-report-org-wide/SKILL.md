# Org-Wide Report (tier 1)

Project a measured per-instance saving across the organization and
close with a summary the whole company can read. Tier 1: team-level
aggregates only, no individual names anywhere. Value is
engineer-hours and capacity; never money.

Read `references/interim-format.md` first — it
defines run location and the completeness gate. Defer these rendering
references until the gate passes; a refused render never loads them:

- `references/provenance.md` — tag rendering,
  anti-inflation rules, the no-currency contract.
- `references/measurement.md` — the
  projection chain `V * F * t * s * a * r`, the population segments,
  and the rule refusing 1.0 defaults.
- `references/audiences.md` — the tier-1
  contract.

User arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Context

Recent runs — run this command and read the output:

```bash
sh -c 'ls -dt "$HOME"/Documents/*/business/ /mnt/c/Users/*/Documents/*/business/ 2>/dev/null' | head -5 | grep . || echo "(no runs found)"
```

## Procedure

### 1. Locate the run

Use the `$ARGUMENTS` path if given, else the newest run per
`interim-format.md`. Confirm the choice with the user.

### 2. Completeness gate

Run the completeness gate from `interim-format.md`. Refuse to render
from an incomplete package; list what is missing and stop.

### 3. Secure the multipliers

Read the deferred references above. Then read adoption `a` and
realization `r` from `assumptions.yaml`. If
either is absent, ask the user via `ask-user-choice` — explain what
each means per `measurement.md` — and append the answer to the
register as an ESTIMATED entry with rationale and owner. Both are
strictly below 1.0. Refuse to proceed with a default of 1.0 for
either.

### 4. Render the report

Write `<run>/reports/org-wide.md` with this fixed structure:

1. **Bottom-up build** — the full chain
   `Annual_hours_saved = V * F * t * s * a * r`, every factor shown
   with its own tag; the population segmented addressable ⊃ served ⊃
   realized, all three reported.
2. **Scenarios** — conservative, base, upside, with the differing
   assumptions listed per scenario.
3. **Sensitivity** — one-way ranking: which single input moves the
   outcome most, in order.
4. **What has to be true** — break-even framing: the values the
   inputs must reach for the projection to hold.
5. **Plain-language summary** — for the whole company: no
   methodology jargon, no formula notation; figures still tagged and
   true.

Team-level aggregates only. If any measurement is per-person, roll
it up before it appears here.

## Output

Open with a one-line hero (`✓ Org-wide projection: <conservative
figure with tag>`, `✓ Evidence report: <supported claim, unknowns
named>`, or `⚠ Refused: <reason>`), then exactly these sections:

1. `## Run` — the run chosen and its pinned window.
2. `## Gate` — the completeness result and the `a`/`r` values used,
   with their register ids.
3. `## Report` — where it was written, the conservative projection,
   and the most sensitive input.

End with an `ask-user-choice` panel: write an internal case study
next, revisit an assumption, or stop. Skip the panel in plan mode or
when running non-interactively.


## Portability notes

- `ask-user-choice` — present the listed options and wait for the user to pick one. Hosts with a structured multiple-choice tool (Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`) should use it; otherwise print a numbered list and wait for a numbered reply. Never proceed on an assumed answer.
- `$ARGUMENTS` — the text the user passed when invoking this skill. If your host does not substitute it, read it as the user's request in the current turn, and ask when there is none.
- Bundled files — every relative path in this skill points at a file shipped inside this skill directory. Read them from here, not from the host's plugin tree.
