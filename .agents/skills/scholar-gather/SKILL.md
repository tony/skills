# this skill

Stage 1. Turn a loose target — a repository, a set of them, a book — into a
pinned, inventoried source list a later stage can cite against.

Read `references/citation.md` for how to pin, and
`references/stage-gates.md` for this stage's exit condition.

User arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## The invariant

```
GATHER NEVER WRITES INTO THE CORPUS IT READS
```

Studying a project must not dirty its checkout. Output lands under `--out`,
defaulting to `notes/ontology/<subject>/` in the current repository. For a
study kept outside any repository, open a dated run with the `research:foray`
skill (`--namespace scholar`, the subject as topic) and pass its directory as
`--out`. The corpus is recorded by URL and ref, not by local path.

## Context

Current repository — run this command and read the output:

```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "(not a git repository)"
```

Existing studies — run this command and read the output:

```bash
ls notes/ontology/ 2>/dev/null || echo "(none)"
```

## Procedure

### 1. Resolve each target to a ref

For a git repository, prefer a release tag; fall back to a 7-character commit
reachable from trunk. Never a branch name — it moves, and every citation built
on it rots silently.

Newest tag of a repository you have not cloned:

```console
$ gh release list --repo OWNER/REPO --limit 1 --exclude-drafts --exclude-pre-releases --json tagName --jq '.[0].tagName'
```

A repository can have thousands of tags and no releases, in which case that
prints nothing. Fall back to the tags:

```console
$ git ls-remote --tags --refs --sort=-v:refname https://github.com/OWNER/REPO
```

For a local checkout, record both the remote and the exact ref:

```console
$ git rev-parse --short HEAD
```

For prose, the ref is the edition — publisher, year, and printing where the
locator scheme depends on it. A page number without an edition is not a
locator.

### 2. Inventory without reading everything

Establish the shape of the corpus cheaply. For code, the module or package
list and the size of each. For prose, the table of contents. For a fleet, the
repository list and what each one is for.

The inventory is what makes the coverage decision in step 3 an informed one
rather than a guess.

### 3. Decide scope with the user

Present the inventory via `ask-user-choice` and settle what will be read. Most
studies should not read everything; the point is to decide deliberately rather
than to run out of attention silently.

### 4. Write sources.jsonl

One row per source, including every source deliberately not read:

```
{"source": "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO", "ref": "v2.40.0", "scope": "src/parser/", "read": true, "why": ""}
{"source": "https://github.com/OWNER/REPO", "ref": "v2.40.0", "scope": "test/", "read": false, "why": "tests name fixtures, not domain concepts"}
```

A study that does not state its coverage boundary is not honest about what it
does not know. `contest`'s completeness pass reads exactly this file.

## Rules

- Never write into the corpus. Never `git checkout`, `git clean`, or edit
  inside a target.
- Every source has a resolved ref before this stage hands off.
- Every skipped source has a reason in `why`. "Out of scope" is not a reason;
  say what it contains and why that does not bear on the vocabulary.
- Where a corpus has no stable anchors, record that the locator is a search
  string rather than a position, so `annotate` and `extract` know.

## Output

Open with a one-line hero (`✓ <subject>: <n> sources pinned, <n> skipped` or
`⚠ Blocked: <reason>`), then exactly these sections:

1. `## Pinned` — each source read, its ref, and how the ref was resolved.
2. `## Skipped` — each source not read, and why.
3. `## Shape` — the inventory that informed the scope decision.

End with an `ask-user-choice` panel offering next steps (for example: run
extract, widen scope, stop here) — skip the panel only in plan mode.


## Portability notes

- `ask-user-choice` — present the listed options and wait for the user to pick one. Hosts with a structured multiple-choice tool (Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`) should use it; otherwise print a numbered list and wait for a numbered reply. Never proceed on an assumed answer.
- `$ARGUMENTS` — the text the user passed when invoking this skill. If your host does not substitute it, read it as the user's request in the current turn, and ask when there is none.
- Bundled files — every relative path in this skill points at a file shipped inside this skill directory. Read them from here, not from the host's plugin tree.
